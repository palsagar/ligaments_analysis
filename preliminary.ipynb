The surface (radial profile) of this axisymmetric ligament is generated by superposing waves of different wavelenghts, the amplitudes of which are **normally distributed**. This newly generated surface is passed through a **low-pass filter**, which allows us to smoothen the profile and circumvent the extremely sharp peaks/kinks on the surface (our solvers don't like discontinuous derivatives). An example of the surface generation and subsequent filtering is shown below -\n",
